    <h1>Privacy Policy for Islam Smart</h1>
    <p>At Islam Smart, we prioritize your privacy and ensure the protection of the information you provide. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store data when you use the Islam Smart app ("the App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Unique User Identification</h3>
    <p>We use Google login to authenticate users. However, we do not collect or store personal details such as your name, email address, or profile picture. Instead, we:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generate a unique ID for your account based on your Google login ID.</li>
        <li>Create a unique device ID using your device's brand, model, and a random UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Purchase Information</h3>
    <p>We use the unique user ID and device ID to manage lifetime purchases within the App. Purchases are tied to your unique IDs and are restricted to a single device unless a transfer is requested.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Location Data</h3>
    <p>Some features of the App may require access to your location data to provide location-based services. This data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To identify and authenticate users: We use the unique user ID generated from your Google login for secure access to your account.</li>
        <li>To track and manage purchases: Your unique user and device IDs are used to manage and validate purchase records, ensuring they are tied to a specific device.</li>
        <li>To provide location-based services: Location data is used locally on your device to offer relevant services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Data Storage in Network Failure: In the event of a network failure, purchase records may be temporarily stored on your device until they can be synchronized with our servers.</li>
        <li>Uninstallation or Data Deletion: If the app is uninstalled or its data is deleted during a network failure, Islam Smart is not responsible for unsynchronized purchase records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal or device data with third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your explicit consent.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations, or to protect our rights or the safety of others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We employ security measures to protect the information stored in the App. While we take significant steps to secure your data, we cannot guarantee absolute protection due to the nature of data transmission and electronic storage.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Update your personal information stored within the App.</li>
        <li>Disable location services through your device settings if you do not wish to provide location data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Request Assistance</h2>
    <p>If you need assistance regarding purchases or account management, please contact us at <a href="mailto:subhi@zmq.in">subhi@zmq.in</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be notified of any significant changes within the App.</p>

    <h2>9. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App does not target individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so that we can promptly delete it.</p>
